    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With the interconnected nature of the internet, one prominent feature is the use of \"review\" websites or platforms, with there being a wide variety of review platforms for different things. Goodreads for books, Trip Advisor for hotels and restaurants, Letterboxd for movies and tv shows, and a multitude of others. One of the most commmon of these websites is Google, as it provides a platform to review almost anything, from a pool to a park to a zoo. The UCI Travel Review Ratings Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tarvel+Review+Ratings#) compiles the ratings from different users across a wide range of places. It includes two types of places which we will be looking at: dance clubs and pubs/bars, both being integral to nightlife within cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one might ask, what value do online reviews hold? When analyzing them, studies have found that online reviews function as a sort of online word of mouth advertising. Weejing Duan, Bin Gu, and Andrew B. Whinston found the extent to which online reviews affected businesses, with them affecting box office numbers, but also being affected by sales of a product (Duan et al., 2008). Online ratings are so impactful, that entire studies, such as the one conducted by Daniel Keller & Maria Kostrominita, centered around giving businesses the best possible route to improving their scores on websites. The mentioned study found critical areas to focus on, such as food quality, service, and over all experience, but also highlighted how not all of these are equally important (Keller & Kostromitina, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we are looking to answer the following question: Between pubs/restaurants and dance club, which of the two has lower ratings? The reason as to why we're asking this is because through our findings, our results could be interpreted as indicators for advertisement companies for which of the two kinds of location they should focus on. Possibly, it could also be an indicator for tourism companies or organizations as to what kinds of businesses need more help with advertising."
